`We're still working on this repo - once the final version is released we will upload instructions to this readme file`

By default, your entire blockchain transaction history and balances are public. All transactions can be seen on block explorers like BSCScan. Anyone who knows that you own a particular address can quickly view your payments, trace the source of your funds, calculate your holdings, and analyze your on-chain activity. On almost all the most populated blockchains, every transaction, every wallet address, every piece of on-chain data is visible to anyone who wishes to see it. That means that like the blockchain, you as an individual are exposed.But what if you did not want your history and balances to be publicly viewed by everyone? What if you wanted anonymity and privacy when it came to your transactions? What if you don't want every financial step of yours to be mapped, tracked, and sold against your will? **This is why DecentraWorld was created, we're simply restoring privacy and financial freedom to humanity. We will not allow governments to invade our, or anyone else's privacy.**&#x20;

 **DecentraMix (DEMIX), product of DecentraWorld's ecosystem, is a cross-chain, non-custodial, universal privacy-preserving protocol with the decentralized governance. DecentraMix applies zkSNARKs to enable transactional privacy for all DeFi components by breaking the on-chain link between depositor and recipient addresses. On other chains,** It uses the smart contracts within this repo, that accepts coins/tokens deposits, which can be withdrawn by a different address. Whenever an asset is withdrawn from DecentraWorld, there is no way to link the withdrawal to the deposit for absolute privacy. On our blockchain, privacy is engraved into each and every transaction by default. We do support compliance across our ecosystem, to keep our platform legal for residents of all countries, we created a compliance page that can prove the origin of the funds sent/received as long as the encrypted note that was given to you at the time of sending/receiving tokens, was saved.&#x20;
