By default, your entire blockchain transaction history and balances are public. All transactions can be seen on block explorers like BSCScan. Anyone who knows that you own a particular address can quickly view your payments, trace the source of your funds, calculate your holdings, and analyze your on-chain activity. On almost all the most populated blockchains, every transaction, every wallet address, every piece of on-chain data is visible to anyone who wishes to see it. That means that like the blockchain, you as an individual are exposed; naked, with your assets written all over you like permanent tattoos.

In recent years, many governments around the world were exposed for using third party companies, to secretly map and KYC wallets to their real-life identities. Most people that use blockchain tech and crypto, are not aware of this major unethical and undemocratic invasion of privacy. For example, were you aware that relayer (RPC) companies such as Infura, track your IP and wallet address with every single transaction? Companies like Trust Wallet, and MetaMask, try to deceive users by stating things such as "We don't store the full IP", or "We don't save any information", but if you will read the small letters in their privacy policies you will find out that they are simply lying. They are putting these false statements in obvious places such as the homepage or when you just download their wallet for the first time, but they won't tell you the full truth. On top of the most popular "decentralized" wallets tracking us and selling the information they collected to other companies, they are using RPC's (relayers) by Infura, the worst company for your privacy. It's funny how the blockchain, that is all about privacy and decentralization, attracted the wrong people to start businesses within it.&#x20;

But what if you did not want your history and balances to be publicly viewed by everyone? What if you wanted anonymity and privacy when it came to your transactions? What if you don't want every financial step of yours to be mapped, tracked, and sold against your will? **This is why DecentraWorld was created, we're simply restoring privacy and financial freedom to humanity. We will not allow governments to invade our, or anyone else's privacy.**&#x20;

We're a group of whitehat developers who believe in what's right, led by Chris the founder of DecentraWorld. We have put together list of applications that are needed to maintain privacy on the blockchain. On top of that, we have also developed our own unique blockchain that have all of our values and believes implemented within it, meaning 100% private blockchain.

DecentraWorld and its ecosystem of DApps were built to address these problems and aims to provide enhanced economic incentives. **DecentraWorld is a cross-chain, non-custodial, universal privacy-preserving protocol with the decentralized governance. DecentraWorld applies zkSNARKs to enable transactional privacy for all DeFi components by breaking the on-chain link between depositor and recipient addresses. On other chains,** It uses a smart contract that accepts coins/tokens deposits, which can be withdrawn by a different address. Whenever an asset is withdrawn from DecentraWorld, there is no way to link the withdrawal to the deposit for absolute privacy. On our blockchain, privacy is engraved into each and every transaction by default. We do support compliance across our ecosystem, to keep our platform legal for residents of all countries, we created a compliance page that can prove the origin of the funds sent/received as long as the encrypted note that was given to you at the time of sending/receiving tokens, was saved.&#x20;
